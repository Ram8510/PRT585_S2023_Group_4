The works have been done in week 5: 

  1. Create an application with practicing to React and Vuejs (please check the github folder)
  2. Research on deploying to Android and iOS using Ionic framework (Please check the personal notes on Teams)
  3. Research but not added the validation







The Ionic framework is a popular open-source UI toolkit for building high-quality mobile (and desktop) apps using web technologies, namely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides tools and services for developing hybrid mobile apps using web technologies that can then be deployed across multiple platforms, including Android and iOS. 

  

Here's a general overview of deploying to Android and iOS using the Ionic framework: 

  

1. Setting Up Your Environment: 

  

Android: 

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). 

- Install the latest version of [Ionic CLI](https://ionicframework.com/docs/cli) and [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/):  

 

  npm install -g ionic cordova 

 

- Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). This will give you the necessary SDK and virtual device to test on. 

  

IOS: 

- Ensure you have a Mac, as this is a requirement for iOS development. 

- Install Xcode from the Mac App Store. 

- Install the iOS platform tools:  

 

  npm install -g ios-deploy 

  

  

2. Creating Your Ionic App: 

- Start a new project: 

 

  ionic start yourAppName templateName 

   

  Replace `yourAppName` with your desired app name and `templateName` with a template like `tabs`, `blank`, or `sidemenu`. 

  

3. Adding Platform: 

To add a target platform (Android or iOS): 

  

ionic cordova platform add android 

OR 

 

ionic cordova platform add ios 

 

  

4. Testing Your App: 

  

Android: 

- Use an emulator: 

   

  ionic cordova emulate android 

   

   

- Or deploy directly to a connected device: 

   

  ionic cordova run android 

   

  

IOS: 

- Use an emulator: 

   

  ionic cordova emulate ios 

   

  

- Or deploy directly to a connected device: 

   

  ionic cordova run ios 

   

  

5. Building for Production: 

  

Android: 

- Build the APK: 

 

  ionic cordova build android --prod --release 

   

IOS: 

- Build for iOS: 

   

  ionic cordova build ios --prod --release 

   

- After building, open the `.xcodeproj` file in `platforms/ios/` in Xcode, then sign and publish your app from there. 

  

6. Deploying to Stores: 

  

Android: 

- You'll need to sign your APK using a key, then you can upload the APK to the Google Play Console. 

  

IOS: 

- Use Xcode to archive and distribute your app. You'll then upload it to App Store Connect. 

  

7. Additional Considerations: 

 

- Live Deploy: Ionic offers a service called 'Live Deploy' which allows you to publish updates to your app without going through the app store approval process every time. 

- Native Plugins: If your app uses native plugins (e.g., Camera, GPS), ensure they're properly installed and tested on both platforms. 

- Design Considerations: Even though Ionic allows you to write once and run everywhere, always consider platform-specific UI/UX guidelines.
